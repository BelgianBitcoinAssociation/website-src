Today, the *Belgian Bitcoin Association* was officialy founded!

Here's a short summary of the inauguration meeting.

1. We discussed various points of the draft charter and agreed to a final version. All decisions have been voted on and accepted
   unanimously. Thomas is currently preparing the English version, which will then be translated into Dutch and French.
2. We elected the director for a 1-year term. As Filip already said, the directors are Filip, Chris, Jérémie, Jean, Thomas and me.

What next? We will translate the charter and send it to all of you. Furthermore, Thomas will file the association's papers with the state, which will be the actual inauguration of the association. We will send the full minutes of the meeting during the next days.

The board will meet soon to discuss the next steps - for now mostly technicalities such as organizing how to communicate, website etc.
